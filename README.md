# Chrome Extention to monitor Angular JS digest cycles

Simple chrome extention injecting https://github.com/pkaminski/digest-hud for monitoring Angular JS digest cycles.
The original Digest HUB was slightly modified to have configuration options and extended stats display.

## To install:
1. Clone to a folder
2. Open chrome://extensions/, enable 'Developers Mode'
3. Load unpacked extention -> choose the folder
4. Open a page with Angular JS

## To switch on/off
1. Open chrome://extensions/
2. Enable/Disable the extention

Thanks to Piotr Kaminski for the original Digest HUD version
